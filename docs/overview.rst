Overview

History
-------

Here, at the `Greek Research and Technology Network <http://grnet.gr/default.asp?pid=1&la=2>`_, we have been developing an IaaS
cloud management software called **synnefo** (or **+nefo**) that is accessed and managed 
via the OpenStack Compute API v1.1. We have also recently deployed synnefo in one of our
datacenters to provide the `~okeanos <http://okeanos.grnet.gr/>`_ IaaS service to the Greek Research and Academic 
Community (currenty in alpha testing phase).

From the early start, we needed a simple command-line tool to test the OpenStack API.
That's why we developed ./kamaki, which proved to be powerful and intuitive enough,
to be used not only for testing purposes but also as a complete Openstack Compute API v1.1
client, able to manage our cloud from the command line.

Once it proved so useful to us, we decided to open the source, so the community can benefit
from it, and ./kamaki can benefit from the community too.


Who uses ./kamaki?
------------------

./kamaki is currently used internally in GRNET by the development team to test the synnefo
software, by the deployment team who operates the ~okeanos service and by all the alpha 
testers using the ~okeanos service and want to access the service from the command line.


Contributing and helping out
----------------------------

For the ./kamaki to improve and be useful to others too, your help is very important.
Any contributions and bug reports will be highly appreciated. Using ./kamaki and sending
us feedback is also a good start.
