CHANGELOG for version 0.9

Bug Fixes:

- Stop shell from destroying the config instance

- Restore 2nd level command syntax in shell [#3736]
- Allow copy of deleted objects by refering to older version [#3737]
- Add image.add_member missing content-length header
- Unquote http respons headers

Changes:

- Change context: kamaki-image-addproperty --> kamaki-image-compute-property
- http logger names: clients.recv/send --> kamaki.clients.recv/send
- Move logger creation and control (except of the actuall logging) to cli
- These PithosClient methods return the metadata of created object [#3656]:
    upload_object, upload_object_unchunked, create_object_by_manifestation
- Cache container info per upload session [#3735]
- Disallow moving deleted objects by version [#3737]

    move and copy
- Rename file/server-meta commands to file/server-metadata

    mkdir, touch, create, move, copy, move, append, truncate, overwrite,
    manifest, upload, delete, purge, unpublish, permissions set/delete, info,
    metadata set/delete, containerlimit set, versioning set, group set/delete,
    upload, overwrite
    - image:
    unregister, members add/delete/set
    -image compute:
    delete, properties delete
    - server: rename, delete, reboot, start, shutdown, firewall-set
    - network: rename, delete, connect
- Add optional json for methods with output [#3732]
    - file:
    list, hashmap, permissions-get, info, metadata-get, quota,
    containerlimit-get, group-list, sharers, versions
    - server: list, info, create, console, addr, metadata-list/set, stats
    - image: list, meta, register, shared, list
    - image compute: list, info, properties-list/get/add/set
    - flavor: list, info
    - network: info, list, create
    - astakos: authenticate
- Transliterate methods to list-get-set-delete command groups:
    - file: permissions, versioning, group and metadata

    - image compute: properties
    - server: firewall, metadata
